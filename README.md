# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

My motivation in comoleting this project was to learn more about jquery and other tools. I built this project to help make it easier to schedule events during the 9-to-5 work-day. The project is a daily-planner web app that changes color during the course of the day to display upcoming, present, and past tasks. I learned more about jquery, DayJS, and similar tools during the course of building the website.
